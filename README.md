This project involved designing, implementing, and optimizing a relational database system using the Bay Area Bike Share dataset to support efficient storage, integrity, and querying of large operational data. The work began with requirement analysis to understand business goals such as usage patterns, demand forecasting, and operational efficiency. An Entity–Relationship (ER) model was developed covering Stations, Trips, Weather, and Status data, followed by rigorous schema design with primary keys, foreign keys, and domain constraints to ensure data integrity. The schema was analyzed using functional dependencies and systematically normalized to Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF) through decomposition, resulting in a well-structured database of nine related tables. In the second phase, the project focused on database performance optimization, where indexed and non-indexed versions of the database were compared. Multiple JOIN queries were written and timed repeatedly to evaluate performance, demonstrating that primary key and secondary indexes significantly reduced query execution time. Additional indexes were strategically added to frequently filtered columns, further improving efficiency. The project highlights strong skills in database modeling, normalization, SQL querying, and performance tuning using MySQL, with a clear focus on real-world scalability and analytical use cases.
